### 👤 Who Am I?
I am Deka, it means 10 in greek language. You might be familiar with my name if you know the metric system.

I am a lifelong learner and software engineer. 

I had worked with and have production experience in:
- software engineering (backend, frontend, fullstack),
- the data science-y and engineering world (databases, distribted data systems, data science, data analytics, 
machine learning, data engineering),  
- the modern trend in devops and cloud native solutions (kubernetes, helm),

and not afraid to venture further to the research world beyond the available tools to make things work better.

### 🧑🏽‍🎨 My Interest

I am keen to learning new things and advancing my skills and experience, not just in technical world
but also growing professionally as a team player.

The thing that currently interest me the most is Data, distributed systems, democratizing data through tools, 
and cloud native solutions. This might sound controversial, but I believe data is above Machine Learning and AI, 
because if you have no good data you can't build good models. Models have little value unless they're in production 
and have users benefitting from them.
