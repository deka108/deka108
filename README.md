### 👤 Who Am I?
I am Deka, it means 10 in greek language. You might be familiar with my name if you know the metric system.

I am a lifelong learner and software engineer. 

I had worked with and have production experience in:
- software engineering (backend, frontend, fullstack),
- the data science-y and engineering world (databases, distributed data systems, data science, data analytics, 
machine learning, data engineering),  
- the modern trends in devops and cloud native solutions (kubernetes, helm),
- the cloud,

and always ready to venture into research beyond the available tools to make things work better.

### 🧑🏽‍🎨 My Interests

I am excited to learning new things and advancing my skills and experience, not just in technical domain
but also to growing professionally and being an excellent team player.

The thing that currently interest me the most is Data, distributed systems, democratizing data through tools, 
and cloud native solutions. This might sound controversial, but I believe data is above Machine Learning and AI, 
because if you have no good data you can't build good models. Models have little value unless they're reproducible,
in production, and have users benefitting from them. So I'm very interested in developing and researching how we can 
develop efficient tools that enable human to benefits from data easily and effectively.
