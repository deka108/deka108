### 👤 Who Am I?
I am Deka, it means 10 in greek language. You might be familiar with my name if you know the metric system.

> I am a lifelong learner and software engineer. I am passionate about developing software tools that make people lives' easier.

I had worked with and have production experience in:
- software engineering (backend, frontend, fullstack, shell scripting, Linux, web development, app development, testing pyramid, etc.),
- the data science-y and engineering world (databases, distributed data systems, data science, data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, data engineering, artificial intelligence, data wrangling, data viz, etc.),
- the modern trends in devops and cloud native solutions (CI/CD pipelines, docker, kubernetes, helm),
- the cloud (AWS, GCP, net in general),

and always ready to venture into research beyond the available tools to make things work better. I believe there is always an opportunity to learn and improve, acquiring new skills and making difficult things easy all boils down to our efforts.

### 🧑🏽‍🎨 My Interests

I am excited to learning new things and advancing my skills and experience, not just in technical domain
but also to growing professionally and being an excellent team player.

The thing that currently interest me the most is Data, distributed systems, democratizing data through tools, 
and cloud native solutions. 

I believe data and software design are essential to Machine Learning and AI, because if you have no good data 
you cannot build good models. And models have little value unless they are reproducible, in production, and 
have users benefitting from them. Thus, I am very interested in developing and researching efficient toolings 
that enable human to benefits from data easily and effectively.
